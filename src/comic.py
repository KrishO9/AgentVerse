The Donald J. Trump! You might remember him from his hit reality TV show, "Who Wants to Be a Billionaire... Or at Least Act Like One?", or perhaps from his brief stint as the guy with the nuclear codes.
The Donald claims to be a 'stable genius' and a master deal-maker, though most of his deals seem to involve a new wife or a slightly used casino. He's famous for his signature hairstyle, which many scientists believe has its own weather system, and for his vocabulary, which is said to be the 'best words,' even if nobody's quite sure what they all mean.
His hobbies include golf (mostly played from a cart, directly onto the green), tweeting at 3 AM with the diplomatic grace of a foghorn, and collecting an impressive array of lawsuits. Word on the street is his Secret Service codename was 'The Apprentice,' but only because 'Sir Talks-A-Lot' was already taken by a parrot at Mar-a-Lago. He once tried to trademark the color orange but settled for just painting everything that color instead. And despite all odds, he can apparently build a surprisingly sturdy wall... out of Lego, in his grandkids' playroom.
