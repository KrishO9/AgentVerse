# Barnaby Buttons Gets Roasted! Highlights from the Comedy Crew
The comedy crew recently got together to roast Donald Trump, and it was a hilarious event. The roasters, including Sharpay, Patty, and Zip, brought their A-game and delivered some amazing zingers.

Some of the best quotes from the night include:
* "Donald Trump's hair has its own gravitational pull, which explains why everything he says seems to be pulling us down into a black hole of absurdity."
* "His master deal-making skills are also impressive, but I'm pretty sure the only thing you've successfully negotiated is the price of your next haircut, and even that's a bad deal."
* "His tweets have been translated into over 100 languages, including 'covfefe,' which roughly translates to 'I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll tweet about it anyway.'"
* "Donald Trump's hair is so famous, it has its own gravitational pull - and also its own hair-brained schemes."
* "His locks may be loaded with hair products, but his tweets are always follically challenged, making them a real mane attraction for anyone looking for a laugh."
* "His hair-raising tweets are the perfect example of how he's always trying to pull the wool over our eyes."
* "Donald Trump's vocabulary is so limited, he makes a thesaurus look like a dictionary, and his tweets are the only things more exhausting than his comb-overs."
* "He's a stable genius, just like his haircut is a stable structure – it's just held together by sheer force of ego and a can of hairspray."

But in all seriousness, Barnaby, if you're reading this, don't worry – we still love you, even if your hair doesn't.
