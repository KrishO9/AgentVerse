# Roast of Donald Trump: Highlights from the Comedy Crew
The comedy crew recently took aim at Donald Trump, and the results were hilarious. Here are a few highlights:
* Donald Trump has his own board game, titled Trump: The Game, which was launched in 1989 and was ultimately discontinued after dismal sales and poor reviews.
* One comedian joked, 'Donald Trump, I hear you've got your own board game, because what's more fun than playing a game about a guy who's always going bankrupt?'
* Another comedian quipped, 'His attempts to trademark the color orange may have failed, but he's managed to trademark a hairstyle that's a "zar" above the rest - in terms of ridiculousness.'
* A third comedian noted, 'Donald Trump's vocabulary is so limited, he makes a dictionary look like a thesaurus, and his sentences are shorter than his fingers.'
In conclusion, while Donald Trump may have been the target of the roast, he can take comfort in the fact that he's still a great source of humor for comedians and audiences alike. And who knows, maybe one day he'll even have his own successful board game - but until then, we'll just have to keep laughing at his expense.
